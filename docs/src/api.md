# API Reference
This page documents the wrapper functions we have for the ImGui API. The
backends are documented separately in [Backends](@ref).

You can always get the current ImGui version with:
```@docs
imgui_version
```

Modules = [CImGui]
Order   = [:constant, :function, :type]
Filter  = t -> nameof(t) âˆ‰ (:imgui_version, :render, :set_backend)
