# CImGui
This package provides a Julia language wrapper for [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui): a thin c-api wrapper programmatically generated for the excellent C++ immediate mode gui [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). Dear ImGui is mainly for creating content creation tools and visualization or debug tools.  Browse [Gallery](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/2265)
to get an idea of its use cases.
